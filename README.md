# ALAB31821 Building an Express Application

## About This Project

In this project, you can visit different pages of the site that was routed and served with express. I utilized the EJS view engine, along with middleware to take care of timestampl logging and downloading an image. A short contact form was created to send a POST request and simply logs the data. I have left an inactive sign in page for further study and practice another day.
